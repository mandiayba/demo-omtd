I. Susceptibility distribution].&#10;The frequencies of isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 680 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 10 hospitals during the period of June 1996 to May 1997. Of the above bacterial isolates, Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 30.4% and a majority of them were Enterococcus faecalis. Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 69.6% and most of them were Escherichia coli. Susceptabilities of several isolated bacteria to antimicrobial agents were as followed; 1. Enterococcus faecalis Ampicillin (ABPC) showed the highest activity against E. faecalis isolated from patients with UTIs. Its MIC90 was 1 microgram/ml. Imipenem (IPM) and vancomycin (VCM) were also active with the MIC90S of 2 micrograms/ml. The others had low activities with the MIC90S of 16 micrograms/ml or above. 2. Staphylococcus aureus including MRSA Arbekacin (ABK) and VCM showed the highest activities against both S. aureus and MRSA isolated from patients with UTIs. The MIC90S of them were 1 or 2 micrograms/ml. The others except minocycline (MINO) had low activities with the MIC90S of 32 micrograms/ml or above. 3. Staphylococcus epidermidis ABK and VCM showed the strongest activities against S. epidermis isolated from patients with UTIs. The MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 2 micrograms/ml. Cefazolin (CEZ), cefotiam (CTM) and cefozopran (CZOP) were also active with the MIC90S of 4 micrograms/ml. Compared with antimicrobial activities of cephems is 1995, the MIC90S of them had changed into a better state. They ranged from 4 micrograms/ml 16 micrograms/ml in 1996. 4. Streptococcus agalactiae All drugs except MINO were active against S. agalactiae. ABPC, CZOP, IPM, and clarithromycin (CAM) showed the highest activities. The MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.125 micromilligrams. Tosufloxacin (TFLX) and VCM were also active with the MIC90S of 0.5 micromilligrams. 5. Citrobacter freundii Gentamicin (GM) showed the highest activity against C. freundii isolated from patients with UTIs. Its MIC90 was 0.5 micrograms/ml. IPM and amikacin (AMK) were also active with the MIC90S of 1 microgram/ml and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. Cefpirome (CPR) and CZOP were also active with the MIC90S of 8 micrograms/ml. The MIC90S of the others were 16 micrograms/ml or above. 6. Enterobacter cloacae IPM showed the highest activity against E. cloacae. The MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.5 microgram/ml. The MIC90S of ciprofloxacin (CPFX) and TFLX were 1 microgram/ml, the MIC90 of AMK was 2 micrograms/ml, the MIC90S of CZOP, GM and ofloxacin (OFLX) were 4 micrograms/ml. The MIC50S of cephems except CEZ, cefmetazole (CMZ) and cefaclor (CCL) had changed into a better state in 1996, compared with those in 1995. 7. Escherichia coli All drugs except penicillins and MINO were active against E. coli. Particularly CPR, CZOP and IPM showed the highest activities against E. coli. The MIC90S of them were 0.125 microgram/ml or below. Among E. coli strains, those with low susceptibilities to cephems except CEZ, cefoperazone (CPZ), latamoxef (LMOX) and CCL have increased in 1996, compared with those in 1995. 8. Klebsiella pneumoniae K. pneumoniae was susceptible to all drugs except penicillins, with the MIC90S of 2 micrograms/ml or below. CPR had the strongest activity, the MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.25 microgram/ml. Flomoxef (FMOX), cefixime (CFIX), CZOP and carumonam (CRMN) were also active with the MIC90S of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. 9. Pseudomonas aeruginosa All drugs except quinolones were not so active against P. aeruginosa with the MIC90S were 32 micrograms/ml or above. Quinolones were more active in 1996 than 1995. The MIC90S of them were between 4 micrograms/ml and 8 micrograms/ml, and the MIC50S of them were between 1 microgram/ml and 2 micrograms/ml. 10. Serratia marcescens GM showed the highest activity against S. marcescens. Its MIC90 was 1 micro&#10;"/>
